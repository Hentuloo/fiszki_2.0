Hello!
It is my flash-cards project.

if you want to check it you must have data-base import: data-base.sql

database name in my project is 'flash_cards' or change in config.php where you can set your database name dbname=>'your name' 

database have two users: *you can create new account in registration.php

1. login: user password user1234
